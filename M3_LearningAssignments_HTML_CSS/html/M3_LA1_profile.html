                <p>Given that these pargraphs do not have to make any sense, I thought I'd also include basic information about the game of hockey.
                Hockey is one of the fastest games on earth and one of the easiest to understand.
                Each side plays six men at a time (unless someone has been put in the penalty box).
                Substitutions are made when play stops or can be made "on the fly" while play is in progress.
                The positions are goalkeeper, left and right defense, center, left and right wing.   
                Once you've learned the three basic rules you'll be on your way to understanding the game.
                Games are divided into three periods. The amount in each period depends on the length of the game.   
                A team scores when one of its players shoots the puck into the opponent's net with his stick.
                Players who help set up a goal get assists, but only two assists can be scored on a goal.  
                In some leagues if a game ends in a tie, a 5 minute sudden death overtime period or shoot out is played.

            <p>I love movies, but don't get to go to a movie theatre very often. Follow this link to find out a few movies that are currently playing in the Calgary Area.
